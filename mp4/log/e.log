standard e test
 
Seed: 1765640879
First-fit search policy without coalescing

Equilibrium test driver using Mem_alloc and Mem_free from mem.c
  Trials in equilibrium: 100000
  Warmup allocations: 1000
  Average array size: 128
  Range for average array size: 127
After warmup
the student must implement mem stats

After exercise, time=2611.41
the student must implement mem stats
#items in linked-list:49856, min:32, max:976, avrage:256, #Pages:3220, #bytes: 12979648, #SbrkCalls:3220

After cleanup
the student must implement mem stats
all memory is in the heap -- no leaks are possible
